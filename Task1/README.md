**Responsive Wiki Page Design Notes**

**1. Introduction**
This document outlines how the provided wiki page layout is adapted for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). It also highlights essential UX considerations and best practices for building responsive websites.

**2. Layout Breakdown**
The wiki page consists of the following structural elements:

* **Header**: Breadcrumb navigation and search input
* **Top Navigation Bar**: User-related links, print icon, hamburger, and user icon
* **Sidebar (Left)**: Navigation buttons (Page Operations, Browse Space, Add Content)
* **Main Content**: Title, image, description, action links, comments section
* **User Sidebar (Right)**: Collapsible user menu on small screens (Welcome Peldi, History, Preferences, Administration, Logout)

**3. Responsive Behavior and Layout Adaptation**

**A. Mobile (<=600px)**

* Sidebar becomes a slide-in panel controlled by a hamburger icon
* Top navigation links are hidden and replaced by a user icon to save space
* Header layout becomes vertical to fit small widths
* Font sizes and paddings are reduced to fit compact screen sizes

**B. Tablet (601px - 1024px)**

* Sidebar remains visible and takes up 25% width
* Top navigation reappears with flexible wrapping for links
* Adjustments to paddings and font sizes for medium screens

**C. Desktop (>1024px)**

* Sidebar is fixed and always visible on the left
* Full top navigation bar and print icon are displayed
* Layout uses horizontal alignment with enough space for all elements

**4. UX Considerations**

* **Accessible Navigation**: Hamburger and close buttons include ARIA labels
* **Keyboard Navigation**: Sidebar close button gains focus when sidebar is opened
* **Touch Optimization**: Buttons have padding and spacing suitable for tapping
* **Flexible Layout**: Use of `flex` and `media queries` to reorganize layout dynamically

**5. Best Practices Followed**

* Use of semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>`)
* ARIA roles and labels for accessibility support
* Clear visual hierarchy and consistent spacing
* Mobile-first media queries and progressive enhancement
* CSS transitions for smooth sidebar and UI animations

**6. Conclusion**
This design ensures that the wiki page remains functional, accessible, and visually coherent across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. It balances usability and performance, ensuring a positive experience for all users.
